## Projects

**Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects**<br>
- **Neural Network and Deep Learning**<br>
Implementation logistic regression, deep neural networks from scratch help me understand deeply about 
this network.<br>
- **Traffic Sign Classification**<br>
Designed a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Performed image pre-processing and validation to prevent overfitting. The model achieved 96% accuracy on the test set

- **CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition**




**Tic Tac Toe Vs AI**
<br><br>An implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, a human player can choose to play vs AI, the AI's purpose is not to lose. Min-max algorithm was used to determine AI's behavior[[Source code]](google.com)[[Video Demo]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0m18zlawGU)

## Honors and Awards




## Publications
- **Can Ensemble Deep Learning Identify People by Their Gait Using Data Collected from Multi-Modal Sensors in Their Insole ?**
<br>Dr. Jucheol Moon, Nelson Hebert Minaya, **Nhat Anh Le**, Hee-Chan Park, San-II Choi [[PDF]](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/14/4001)<br>
  - Proposed a novel method to detect the human gait precisely from the raw gait information gathered in insoles. 
  - Developed an ensemble model that uses CNN and RNN in a cooperative and complementary manner to identify users from their gait information with accuray of over 99 %
